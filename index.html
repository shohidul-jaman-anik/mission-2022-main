            <p>The most effective and sustainable developer communities are much more than a fan club or a thinly veiled way to generate demand. The best developer communities are the ones that actually offer members a way to be actively involved in what’s
                happening with the product and among users. These communities offer developers a variety of ways to engage—learning from others, teaching others and even partnering with the product team. The space should be open, collaborative and respectful.
                And it should encourage dialogue. But before you can attain such heights, you have to start where every other developer community starts—at ground zero.</p>

                <p>The goal of these meeting is more or less - general team building, to share the knowledge of what everyone is working on, and to keep everyone aware of shifting company initiatives. It is not to formally 'hand out' work assignments (that
                    is done via other means).</p>

                <p>It's a knowledge work profession and an office job. But so are a lot of things in the office. At the end of the day, what programmers do at work is show up, work in the office, and leave, albeit with a specific and often societally romanticized
                    specialty.
